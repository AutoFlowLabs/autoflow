## Setup

### Install 

import { Tabs } from 'nextra/components'
 
<Tabs items={['pnpm', 'npm', 'yarn']} defaultIndex="0">
  <Tabs.Tab>
    ```
      pnpm install -D @autoflowlabs/playwright @playwright/test
    ```
  </Tabs.Tab>
  <Tabs.Tab>
    ```
      npm install -D @autoflowlabs/playwright @playwright/test
    ```
  </Tabs.Tab>
  <Tabs.Tab>
    ```
      yarn add --dev @autoflowlabs/playwright @playwright/test
    ```
  </Tabs.Tab>
</Tabs>

### Setting up the API Token

  This library requires access to a specific environment variable that contains your AutoFlow token, which is essential for the playwright process. This token can be found in your account on https://autoflow.tools. You can expose this variable in various ways. One option is to set it as an environment variable, as demonstrated below:

  ```sh
  $ export AUTOFLOW_TOKEN="<your token here>"
  ```

  Alternatively, you can store this token in a configuration file named `autoflow.config.json` located in your project's root directory, structured like this:

  ```json
  {
    "TOKEN": "<your token here>"
  }
  ```

### Get Set Flow!

Utilize and incorporate the `autoflow()` function into your codebase by importing it as shown:

```ts
import { test } from "@playwright/test";
import { autoflow } from "@autoflowlabs/playwright";

test("autoflow example", async ({ page }) => {
  await page.goto("https://google.com/");

  // An object with page and test must be passed into every call
  const testArgs = { page, test };
  const searchButtonText = await autoflow("Get the search button text", testArgs);
  await page.goto("https://google.com/");
  await autoflow(`Type "${searchButtonText}" in the search box`, testArgs, {flowType: "action"});
  await autoflow("Press enter", testArgs, {flowType: "action"});
});
```
